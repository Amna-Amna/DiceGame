In this game, players take turns rolling a dice. Each roll of the dice holds the potential to either add to the player's accumulated numbers or wipe them out entirely. If a player rolls a 1 on the dice, they will lose all of their accumulated numbers unless they have chosen to "hold" them. The idea behind the "hold" function is to allow players to safeguard their numbers and prevent losing them all in one roll. The ultimate goal of the game is to reach 50 points first. This is achieved by accumulating numbers through multiple rolls of the dice without rolling a 1. The player who reaches 50 points first is declared the winner. The game can be restarted at any time by clicking the "new game" button, allowing players to compete against each other in multiple rounds.
